# Crypto_transcriptomics
Transcriptomics data incorporation into the Cryptosporidium parvum IowaII metabolic model. The metabolic model was generated by Maureen et al (https://github.com/maureencarey/paradigm). The transcriptomic data was retrieved from the GEO database and is associated with the Transcriptome profiling of C. parvum infected lung and intestinal organoids (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE112991), carried out by Heo et al, 2018. 

The data incorporation was performed with the programa RIPTiDe developed by Jenior et al, 2020 (https://github.com/mjenior/riptide).

Additionally, a comparison of the blocked reactions was performed for the Cryptosporidium models reported in Paradigma.
